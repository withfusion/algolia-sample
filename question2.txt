Question 2: Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Matt,

Thank you for your feedback regarding our new dashboard design -- it is truly appreciated and we take all such feedback very seriously.

I understand that you are not happy with the new dashboard design and for that I apologize. When making UI choices, we go through a comprehensive process to determine how our dashboards will function and look. A number of factors inform how those decisions are made, including new functionality requirements, new technologies, and user feedback.

While we understand that not everyone is going to be completely happy with some of the changes we make, I want to make it very clear that customer satisfaction is our top priority and that we listen to all customer feedback. In this case I will forward your feedback to our UI/UX team so that they can take this into consideration while they continue to improve upon our overall user experience.

Is there anything else on the new dashboard that you'd like them to consider?

Thanks,
Jon Belelieu, Solutions Engineer, Algolia
